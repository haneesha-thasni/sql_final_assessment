# SQL Practice Questions Using MySQL

Welcome to my SQL Practice Repository! This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to strengthen my understanding of SQL concepts and MySQL specifically. Through solving real-world scenarios, I aim to refine my skills in database querying, manipulation, and optimization. Below is a detailed list of the SQL questions I worked on, along with the key concepts they explore.

## üìö Questions and Concepts Explored

1. Select all employees from the HR department:

    Basic SELECT statement with WHERE clause.

2. Count the number of employees in each department:

    Aggregation using COUNT() and GROUP BY.

3. Find employees with a salary greater than the average salary:

    Subqueries and comparison with AVG().

4. Find departments with more than 2 employees:

    Filtering grouped results with HAVING.

5. List employees along with their department information:

    Joining tables using INNER JOIN.

6. List all departments and their employees, even if there are no employees assigned:
  
    Using LEFT JOIN for inclusive data.

7. Find the highest salary among all employees:

    Using MAX() function.

8. Find the average salary for each department:

    Aggregating data with AVG() and GROUP BY.

9. Calculate the total salary for each department:

    Using SUM() for total calculation.

10. Rank employees by salary within each department:

    Utilizing RANK() or DENSE_RANK() window functions.

11. Find the employee with the highest salary in each department:

    Combining GROUP BY and MAX() or using window functions.

12. List employees whose names start with 'A':

    Using LIKE with wildcard %.

13. Find employees with salaries between 60000 and 80000:

    Using the BETWEEN operator.

14. List departments located in 'Headquarters' or 'Tech Park':

    Filtering with IN operator.

15. Count the number of employees per character length of their name:

    Using LENGTH() function and GROUP BY.

16. Find employees whose name contains 'son':

    Pattern matching with LIKE.

17. Find the employee with the lowest salary:

    Using MIN() function.

18. Find employees whose department is not 'HR':

    Filtering with NOT in the WHERE clause.

19. List employees with a salary greater than 60000 and sorted by salary in descending order:

    Combining WHERE and ORDER BY.

20. List all employees along with their department and location, but only for departments with more than 1 employee:

    Using HAVING with COUNT() and joins.

21. Find the department with the highest average salary among employees:

    Using AVG() and ordering results with ORDER BY.

22. List all employees who have the same salary as at least one other employee:

    Utilizing COUNT() and GROUP BY with HAVING.

23. Find the employee(s) with the highest salary in each location:
  
    Combining GROUP BY and MAX() or using window functions.

24. List all departments and the average salary of employees within each department, sorted by average salary in descending order:

    Aggregating with AVG() and ordering results.

25. Find the employee(s) with the highest salary who are not in the 'Admin' department:

    Combining WHERE and MAX() or window functions.

26. Find the employee(s) with the second-highest salary:

    Using LIMIT, OFFSET, or window functions.
